  Features
  ------------

  * **Dynamic, intelligent auto-completions**
  	* fully object-oriented completions
  	* context sensitive completions (e.g. in the defaultproperties block you only want to get variables)
  	* content assist. You wont have to open the editor anymore to search for asset names.
  	* parameter hints
  	* display documentation when you need it
  	* completions feel like the great Sublime Text 2/3 snippets

  * **Go to declaration and back again**
  	* object-oriented go to declaration (pressing it over controller.GetPlayerViewPoint(a, b) will take you to the declaration of GetPlayerViewPoint in Controller)
  	* go to the declaration of the currently selected word via F10, alt + left click, right click menu, 'Goto' -> 'UnrealScript Goto Declaration' or search for it in in the command palette
  	* when browsing in the declarations you can always return to your starting position by using one of the above keys when nothing is under your cursor.

  * **Debugger**
  	* UnrealScript IDE comes with [UnrealDebugger](https://code.google.com/p/unreal-debugger/) integrated.
  	* You can set breakpoints directly inside Sublime Text 2/3
  	* [more information](https://github.com/Zinggi/UnrealScriptIDE/wiki/Usage#debugger)

  * **Syntax highlighting**
  	* For .uc files and .log files

  * **Build system**
  	* to build your game use Ctrl + B, F7 or search for it in the command palette.
  	* if the build contains errors, the error log will be opened, allowing you to navigate to your errors quickly.
  	* if the build was successful, the game will start

  * **Launch Game**
  	* quickly open the game with your last configuration
  	* you can chose which map to open
  	* chose between Standalone or a Server and 2 Clients or add any other configuration you might like
  	* [more information](https://github.com/Zinggi/UnrealScriptIDE/wiki/Usage#launch-game)

  * **Various useful Snippets**
  	* predefined Snippets for standard classes, and language features such as defaultproperties

  * **Add bookmarks to your comments**
  	* to add a bookmark write your comments like this: // ! text or /** ! text*/
  	* navigate to them quickly via Ctrl + R

  * **More coming...**

  My auto-complete settings
  ------------
  Here are some relevant settings for auto-completion that I've found quite helpful:

  	{
  		"auto_complete_with_fields": true,	//this allows auto-completion inside snippets.
  		"auto_complete_triggers":	//this activates auto-completion on '.'
  		[
  			{
  				"characters": ".",
  				"selector": "source.unrealscript"
  			}
  		],
  		"auto_complete_delay": 0,
  		"auto_complete_commit_on_tab": true,	// I prefer 'tab' to 'enter'
  	}
